    <p style="color:black"> To build a software program, a programming language is
     a series of commands, instructions, and other syntax uses. Languages used by 
   programmers to write code are called "high-level languages," which can be compiled
    into a "low-level language" that is directly recognized by the computer hardware."</p>
