    <td>Hypertext Markup Language ( HTML) is the standard language of markup
     for documents intended for display in a web browser. Technologies like Cascading
      Style Sheets ( CSS) and scripting languages like JavaScript can assist in this.

        the documents into web pages of multimedia. HTML describes semantically and originally
         included web page structure indications for the document 's appearance.</td>
     <td>PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language which is particularly suitable
      for web development. It was originally developed by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus 
      Lerdorf in 1994, The PHP Community now produces the PHP Reference Implementation. PHP 
originally represented Personal Home Page but now stands for PHP's recursive initialism: Hypertext Preprocessor. 
An executable PHP interpreter implemented as a module, daemon, or Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
 usually processes PHP code on a web server. An integral or part of a server's HTTP response would be
  the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code on a web server â€“ which could be any type of data, 
such as generated HTML or binary image data.</td>
